# Denial of Service (DoS) with Rust

This is a Rust project that demonstrates how to perform a Denial of Service (DoS) attack for the purpose of stress testing systems and evaluating their limits (**not for malicious intent**).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Rust installed on your machine. You can download Rust from the official Rust website: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Installing Dependencies

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the DoS project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

```
cargo build
```

This command will download and install all the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can run the DoS project with the following command:

```
cargo run
```

This command will compile the project and execute it.

## Project Structure

The DoS Rust project has the following directory structure:

```
DoS/
├── src/
│   └── main.rs
├── Cargo.toml
└── README.md
```

- `src/main.rs`: This is the main file of the Rust project, where the source code of the program is located.
- `Cargo.toml`: This is the project configuration file, where the dependencies and other information are defined.
- `README.md`: This is the project documentation file, which you are currently reading.
